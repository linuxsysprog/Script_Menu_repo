1. Take the last frame of a video event. Copy and paste it multiple times
   at the end of the event. Thus freezing the last frame for a certain time
   when playing back.

2. Make a Video Progressions type of effect. The screen is split horizontally with
   left/right hand in upper/lower (or vice-versa) half of the screen.

3. Study Takes, 50%, 25% slow down.

4. Study Track left hand/cookie cutter

5. Idea with frames, start every file name with a frame number, then possibly,
   measure number

6. Takes/Moving cookie cutter

TODO:

- Find a way to do typeof().
- Find a way to compile and link without Vegas.
- Convert Common to a singleton
---
- Write a script to generate a series of beeps at a specified tempo.
  Input tempo (period) from a selection.
  Calculate the number of beeps from the length of the "input" track.
- Revise error messages from UtilTrack.GetInputAudioTrack()
- Write a dialog asking "The tempo is ...Continue?"  OK/Cancel
